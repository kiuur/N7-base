## does this script support response on channel? and what are the pros and cons?
This script already supports responses on WhatsApp channels, because it uses Baileys which supports channels, namely [`nstar-y baileys`](https://github.com/nstar-y/Bail), but there is a minus in this script, namely the long time to install the module. but the script will run 100%
