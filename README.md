## does this script support response on channel? 
This script already supports responses on WhatsApp channels, because it uses Baileys which supports channels, namely [`nstar-y baileys`](https://github.com/nstar-y/Bail), but there is a drawback to this script, namely the time needed to install the module is quite long. however, this script still runs.
