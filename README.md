## some little information 
This script already supports responses on WhatsApp channels, because it uses Baileys which supports channels, namely [`nstar-y baileys`](https://github.com/nstar-y/Bail), but there is a drawback to this script, namely the time needed to install the module is quite long. however, this script still runs. get information from me on [WhatsApp channel](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VajP9eX4SpkP50HLW03m), or you can get other information via [GitHub](https://github.com/kiuur)
